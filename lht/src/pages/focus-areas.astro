        <h2>Areas of Focus</h2>
        <p>
          I support folxs navigating a wide range of life experiences. Some of
          these experiences have more tangible names like ‘anxiety’,
          ‘depression’, or ‘grief’…others are challenges and wounds that evade
          labels at times.
        </p>
        <p>
          For those of you who may not have a name for what you are
          experiencing, you are welcome in this space exactly where you are in
          your story. We will journey through the liminality together.
        </p>

          While I provide therapeutic support for a variety of experiences, I
          particularly enjoy supporting folxs through:
