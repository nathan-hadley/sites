        <h2>How I work:</h2>
        <p>
          At the core of my therapeutic approach is my belief that we heal and
          transform through authentic and empathic connection. I view therapy as
          a collaborative process in which we co-create a space to engage what
          has been wounded and find medicine to heal and grow.
        </p>
        <p>
          My therapeutic practice is shaped by my responsibility to be
          anti-racist, my understanding that psychology and therapy are not
          apolitical, and my belief that our identities – complex, unique, and
          intersecting – are relevant in the therapeutic space. I understand
          suffering and distress not as a function of individual pathology, but
          as something that is always in some way connected to the world and
          environment it emerges from.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seeking healing and restoration is a brave and courageous journey that
          goes against all the systems of oppression that seek to wound and
          separate us. I considered it a profound honor to walk with someone in
          this journey through challenges, suffering, wonder, curiosity and
          pain, to find a healing, growth, embodiment and joy that follows us
          beyond the therapy room.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am skilled at using a wide variety of therapeutic approaches
          including attachment work and depth-oriented psychotherapy, focusing,
          play therapy, various trauma and body-based therapies, inner child and
          parts work, and meaning and insight-based therapies. However, I tailor
          my approach to each person based on their unique strengths and
          intentions for therapy.

        <h2>Therapeutic Orientation:</h2>
        <p>
          My primary therapeutic approach is existential, humanistic,
          person-centered, and relational. This means I believe wholeheartedly
          in clients’ worthiness and ability to evolve, and in the power of the
          therapeutic relationship to heal.
        </p>
        <p>
          With clinical skill and relational warmth, I accompany clients as they
          stabilize, make meaning of their life, and find their way into
          well-being.

        <h2>Professional Journey:</h2>
        <p>
          Throughout my life, a guiding compass has been my commitment to
          supporting others meet fundamental rights and needs, and experience
          welcome, connection and well-being. I became a therapist after working
          for 8 years alongside refugees, immigrants, and asylum seekers – a
          community which taught me how to honor every person’s unique humanity,
          work for peace, and forefront hospitality in my life.
        </p>
        <p>
          My work alongside these communities also shaped the lenses through
          which I see the world, better attuning me to how systems of
          oppression, generational trauma, loss of home, White supremacy, and
          American exceptionalism powerfully control and distort lives and
          communities. In working as a therapist, I continue my commitment to
          supporting marginalized communities and de-centering white, Western
          understandings of suffering, healing, and being. I continuously ground
          my work in social justice and liberation practices that seek to
          understand and dismantle oppressive systems that contribute to
          individual, communal, and environmental suffering.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hold a masters degree in Psychology from Seattle University with an
          emphasis on the existential phenomenological tradition – a tradition
          that grounds me in a continuous curiosity about the lived experience
          of the individual sitting across from me and how they create meaning
          in their life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each client I have ever worked with has been my teacher in life, and I
          consider it a deep honor to have our paths cross. I consider this work
          the greatest and most worthy way I could spend my time. To those with
          whom I will cross paths: I am honored, and so eager to know you.
